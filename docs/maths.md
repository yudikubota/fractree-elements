Okay, I've analyzed the mathematical definitions you provided and the JavaScript code in `assets/js/geometry.js`. Here's a mathematically accurate and rigorous description of the figure's construction:

The figure is generated using a combination of fundamental geometric shapes (circles), procedural generation of radial elements (spokes), and SVG masking techniques. The geometry is parameterized by three positive values: $r$ (radius), $d$ (offset), and $h$ (auxiliary offset).

**1. Foundational Geometric Circles**

The geometric basis is defined by six circles in a 2D Cartesian plane $(x,y)$. The origin (0,0) of this mathematical plane corresponds to the visual center of the SVG canvas (`CENTER_X`, `CENTER_Y` in the code).

*   **Inner Circle ($C_1$)**: $f_1(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - r^2 = 0$
    *   Center: (0,0), Radius: $r$
*   **Top Mid-Circle ($C_2$)**: $f_2(x,y) = x^2 + (y-d)^2 - (r+d)^2 = 0$
    *   Center: (0,d), Radius: $r+d$
*   **Bottom Mid-Circle ($C_3$)**: $f_3(x,y) = x^2 + (y+d)^2 - (r+d)^2 = 0$
    *   Center: (0,-d), Radius: $r+d$
*   **Outer Circle ($C_4$)**: $f_4(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - (r+2d)^2 = 0$
    *   Center: (0,0), Radius: $r+2d$
*   **Upper Auxiliary Circle ($C_5$)**: $f_5(x,y) = x^2 + (y-h)^2 - (2h)^2 = 0$
    *   Center: (0,h), Radius: $2h$
*   **Lower Auxiliary Circle ($C_6$)**: $f_6(x,y) = x^2 + (y+h)^2 - (2h)^2 = 0$
    *   Center: (0,-h), Radius: $2h$

The implicit equation $F(x,y) = \prod_{k=1}^{6} f_k(x,y) = 0$ describes the boundary of the union of these six circles. However, the generated visual figure utilizes these circles as references for constructing more complex SVG elements, primarily radial "spokes" and applying masks, rather than directly plotting this combined zero-set.

**2. Primary Visual Elements: Radial Spokes**

The main visual components of the figure are radial lines, referred to as "spokes," generated procedurally.

*   **Generation**: Each spoke is an SVG line segment. In the mathematical plane, it extends from a point $(r_{inner} \cos\theta, r_{inner} \sin\theta)$ to $(r_{outer} \cos\theta, r_{outer} \sin\theta)$ for a given angle $\theta$. The parameters $r_{inner}$ and $r_{outer}$ are typically derived from the radii of the foundational circles ($C_1$ to $C_4$), defining the radial extent of sets of spokes.
*   **Angular Distribution**: Spokes are usually distributed around the center, with angles $\theta_i = \theta_{offset} + i \cdot \frac{2\pi}{\text{count}}$ for $i = 0, \dots, \text{count}-1$, where `count` is the number of spokes and $\theta_{offset}$ is an initial angular offset.
*   **Variable Thickness**: The thickness (stroke-width) of each spoke is dynamically calculated based on its angle $\theta$. The thickness $W(\theta)$ is given by:
    $$ W(\theta) = t_{min} + (t_{max} - t_{min}) \cdot G(\theta, \theta_{peak}, \text{inverted}) $$
    where $t_{min}$ and $t_{max}$ are the minimum and maximum possible thicknesses. The function $G$ represents a normalized gradient:
    Let $\phi = \frac{(\theta - \theta_{peak}) \pmod{2\pi}}{2\pi}$ be the normalized angular distance from a `peakAngle` $\theta_{peak}$.
    Then $G = (1 - \phi)$ for a standard gradient (thickness decreases away from $\theta_{peak}$) or $G = \phi$ for an inverted gradient (thickness increases away from $\theta_{peak}$). This results in a smooth, aesthetically pleasing variation in the visual weight of the spokes.

**3. Key Masking Element: The Lens of Intersection**

A significant visual feature is achieved by a mask derived from the geometric intersection of the two auxiliary circles, $C_5$ and $C_6$.

*   **Auxiliary Circles Recap**:
    *   $C_5$: Center $(0, h)$, radius $2h$.
    *   $C_6$: Center $(0, -h)$, radius $2h$.
*   **Intersection Region (Lens Shape)**: Provided $h > 0$, these two circles intersect at two points: $P_1 = (-h\sqrt{3}, 0)$ and $P_2 = (h\sqrt{3}, 0)$. The common area enclosed by these circles forms a lens-shaped region, symmetric about the x-axis (the horizontal axis).
*   **Mask Construction**: An SVG mask is defined to match this lens shape. The boundary of the lens is composed of two circular arcs:
    1.  An arc belonging to $C_6$ (center $(0, -h)$, radius $2h$) extending from $P_1$ to $P_2$.
    2.  An arc belonging to $C_5$ (center $(0, h)$, radius $2h$) extending from $P_2$ back to $P_1$.
*   **Visual Effect**: This mask is configured to be "white" (revealing) within the lens area and "black" (hiding) outside of it. Consequently, any visual elements (like the spokes) to which this mask is applied will only be visible within this mathematically defined lens. This is implemented by the `createAuxiliaryIntersectionMask` function.

**4. General-Purpose Masking Capabilities**

The `geometry.js` code also defines a more versatile mechanism for creating SVG masks (`createMask` function). These masks can be constructed from:

*   **Half-planes**: Rectangular areas that can cover one side of the viewing area.
*   **Semicircular or Annular Segments**: The `generateSemiPath` function creates path data for portions of a ring (defined by an `innerRadius` and `outerRadius`). These shapes can be combined additively (to reveal more) or subtractively (to hide more).
*   **Transformations**: These composite mask shapes can be translated and rotated, allowing for complex and precisely positioned masking regions.
    This general masking capability enables sophisticated layering and shaping of different sets of spokes or other graphical elements, possibly using the radii and positions of circles $C_1$ through $C_4$ as guiding parameters for the mask geometry.

**5. Overall Figure Composition**

The final intricate figure is an SVG image assembled through the following process:

*   **Spoke Generation**: One or more sets of radial spokes are generated. These sets can differ in their inner/outer radii ($r_{inner}, r_{outer}$), count, color, thickness parameters ($t_{min}, t_{max}$), and peak angle ($\theta_{peak}$).
*   **Mask Application**: These generated spokes (and potentially other SVG elements) are subjected to one or more masking operations.
    *   The lens-shaped mask, derived from the intersection of auxiliary circles $C_5$ and $C_6$, typically defines a prominent visible region or frames a central part of the design.
    *   Additional masks, built using the general-purpose masking tools, may be employed for further refinement, creating layers, or achieving other complex visual effects by selectively showing or hiding parts of the underlying graphics.

This multi-step process, combining basic geometric definitions with procedural generation and advanced masking, allows for the creation of visually rich and mathematically defined fractal-like patterns. The parameters $r, d,$ and $h$ control the fundamental proportions and characteristics of these patterns.
